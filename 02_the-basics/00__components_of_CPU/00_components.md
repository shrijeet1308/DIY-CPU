#  commponents of CPU

 yes!! you read it right, cpu also has its own components or say, parts. These components are organised in such a way that they work toghether to outperform all the millions of calculations. 
 in this section we will take a look over all the components of a cpu in detail and simple way.

## what are the actual componentsü§î??
  In a cpu the components are categorised as:-
  - core level components
  - cache subsystem components
  - system level components
  - execution-suppor componenets
  - advance components

  this list of components occour in today's modern 64 & 32 CPUs (‚óè'‚ó°'‚óè), we need to study them to get the understanding and the flow of logic implementation in a CPU.

  ## üîócomponents categorised
  the components of the cpu are just listed here according to their category. The detailed description of each of them will be given in the next section.

  ### ‚úÖ core level components

  - ALU - arithematic logic unit
  - FPU - floating point unit
  - SIMD units - single input multiple data units
  - register files
  - instruction decoder
  - micro-op que
  - Reorder buffer
  - reservation buffer
  - load/store units
  - branch predictor
  - return address stack
  - instruction fetch unit
  - instruction TLB- instruction translation lookaside buffer
  - data TLB
  - out-of-order execution engine
  - preftech unit

  ### ‚úÖcache subsystem

  - L1 cache
  - L2 cache
  - L3 cache
  - L4 cache (optional)

  ---

  ### ‚úÖsystem-level components
- Memory controller
- interconnect fabric
- PCIe controller
- interrupt controller
- power management unit
- performance monitoring counters
- clock generator
- security engine (optional)

---

### ‚úÖExecution-support Subsystem

- pipeline stages
- hyperthreading/ simultaneous multi-threading
- speculative execution units
- branch target buffer
- return stack buffer

---

### ‚úÖadvanced features (modern CPUs)

- vritualization support
- instruction set extensions
- hardware accelrators
- thermal sensors & throttling units
- error correction

now after seeing all this, i was also wonderes that how many components these are. In our next topic we will see the deatailed explantion of all of these.
