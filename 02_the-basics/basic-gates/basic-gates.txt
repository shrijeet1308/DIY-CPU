🧠 Logic Gates — Basics and Derived
In this section, we'll cover all the essential basic and derived logic gates, their purpose, and how some gates can be constructed using combinations of others.

🔹 Basic Gates
The most commonly used basic gates in digital logic are:

AND Gate

OR Gate

NOT Gate

XOR Gate

These are the fundamental building blocks of digital circuits. Everything else can be derived from these.

🔹 Derived Gates
Derived gates are gates that are built by combining two or more basic gates. These include:

NAND Gate

NOR Gate

XNOR Gate

🔥 Fun Fact: The NOR gate is a universal gate — which means you can construct any logic gate using just NOR gates.

🛠 Gate Construction Using Basic Components
Now, let’s walk through how to build some gates using other gates:

1️⃣ Constructing a NAND Gate using AND + NOT
To create a NAND gate:

First, connect your inputs to an AND gate

Then, pass the output of the AND gate through a NOT gate

The NOT gate inverts the result of the AND operation
✅ Output: NAND

2️⃣ Constructing a NOR Gate using OR + NOT
To create a NOR gate:

Connect your inputs to an OR gate

Then pass the output through a NOT gate

This inversion gives you the NOR output
✅ Output: NOR

3️⃣ Constructing a NOT Gate using NOR
You can create a NOT gate using a single NOR gate by:

Connecting the same input to both inputs of the NOR gate

Since NOR performs NOT (A + A) = NOT A
✅ Output: NOT

4️⃣ Constructing an AND Gate using only NOR Gates
Using De Morgan’s Law:

java
Copy
Edit
A AND B = NOT (NOT A OR NOT B)
Steps:

Invert both inputs using two NOR-based NOT gates

Feed both inverted inputs into another NOR gate

The double inversion cancels out and results in AND behavior
✅ Output: AND

5️⃣ Constructing an OR Gate using NOR + NOT
To construct an OR gate:

First, use a NOR gate for your inputs (this gives you the inverse of OR)

Then invert the output using a NOT gate
✅ Output: OR
