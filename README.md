# üß† DIY CPU ‚Äî Built from the Ground Up

This repository documents every single step of my journey to build a fully functional CPU *from scratch*.  
No pre-built kits. No shortcuts. Just pure logic gates, curiosity, and a hacker mindset.

---

## üöÄ Why This Project?

Ever stared at a tiny 2x2cm silicon chip and thought,  
*"How the hell does this thing run an entire universe of code?"*

Same.

That spark of curiosity kicked off this wild journey ‚Äî to craft a **working CPU** that can perform basic calculations, understand binary logic, and evolve from nothing but logic gates and code.

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Inside?

- All designs created using **Logisim Evolution**
- Step-by-step circuit files ‚Äî from logic gates ‚Üí ALU ‚Üí control unit ‚Üí full CPU
- Will eventually migrate the entire system to **breadboards & physical hardware**
- Open-source documentation, learnings, and schematics for everyone to explore
- all the .circ files can be opened using any visual circuit designing software. In my case, i am using the **logisim evolution**.
