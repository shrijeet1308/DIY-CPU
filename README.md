#  DIY CPU – Built from Scratch

Yo! Welcome to my little corner of chaos.  
I’m building a CPU from the ground up—no prefbuilt kits, zero hand-holding, and definitely no clue what I was getting into. Just some wires, a whole mess of logic gates, and raw curiosity.  
we are starting this from scratch till a 16 bit cpu. No matter how much time or efforts  it takes, i am going to make it done .

##  why i started this?

Ever look at a CPU and thought,  
*"Wait, seriously, this microscopic thing is running games, the Internet, and like, everything?!"*  
Yeah. That made me astonished.

So screw it. I decided to *just make one*. A real, actual CPU, starting at absolute zero. Did I know what I was doing? Nope! Did I dive in anyway? Yup.

## what does this repo has???

- Circuits made in **Logisim Evolution** (I kinda vibe with the retro look, ngl)
- Every single step: logic gates → ALU → control unit → full freakin’ CPU
- Planning to yank this whole thing out of the screen and onto real-life breadboards (wish me luck)
- Failed attempts, dumb mistakes, hacks, and actual working schematics, all open-source for anyone to roast or learn from
- `.circ` files work on any visual circuit thingy, but honestly, **Logisim Evolution** is easiest
