# üß† DIY CPU ‚Äî Built from the Ground Up

This repository documents every single step of my journey to build a fully functional CPU *from scratch*.  
No pre-built kits. No shortcuts. Just pure logic gates, curiosity, and a hacker mindset.

---

## üöÄ Why This Project?

Ever stared at a tiny 2x2cm silicon chip and thought,  
*"How the hell does this thing run an entire universe of code?"*

Same.

That spark of curiosity kicked off this wild journey ‚Äî to craft a **working CPU** that can perform basic calculations, understand binary logic, and evolve from nothing but logic gates and code.

---

## üì¶ What‚Äôs Inside?

- All designs created using **Logisim Evolution**
- Step-by-step circuit files ‚Äî from logic gates ‚Üí ALU ‚Üí control unit ‚Üí full CPU
- Will eventually migrate the entire system to **breadboards & physical hardware**
- Open-source documentation, learnings, and schematics for everyone to explore

---

## üîß Tools Needed (Setup Guide)

> Full instructions are in `setup_guide.txt` but here's the TL;DR:

1. **Design Software:**  
   - Use [Logisim Evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution)  
   - Beginner-friendly and open source

2. **Install Java JDK**  
   - Download and install the latest JDK  
   - Verify:  
     ```bash
     java --version
     ```

3. **Run Logisim**  
   - Once JDK is installed, just run:  
     ```bash
     java -jar logisim-evolution-x.x.x-all.jar
     ```

Boom ‚Äî you‚Äôre inside the circuit matrix üß©
